// Parsing notes:
// Multi character stuff (like == or lim)
// Implicit multiply vs variable name
// dx at the end of an integral
// This stuff happens at the parsing step and doesn't get stored. So, it's possible to first write myF(x) and afterwards define myF
// (tu,ple)
// {s,e,t}
// [ran,ge]
// [ran..ge]
// [matrix]
// |_{lower bound}^{upper bound} after computing an integral
// |abs| and ||norm|| (norm is a separate symbol, in LaTeX it's \Vert)
// 1,2 makes sense in subscripts
// .. and ...
// {a|a in R}, so the bar's meaning depends on the context. But it gets a distinct "tag". And it doesn't have a closing bar.
// does precedence matter? I don't think it does, but maybe there is some mean case where it does...

// Tricky bit,
// > right, so you're not parsing a string so much as you're parsing one tree representation into another one
// > I think there's something like tree grammars but that's definitely more exotic

// \sum_{i=1} (i+j)
// i is the sum's index variable while j is an unbound variable

// Annotated symbols support? (unmatched bracket, colors, ...)

// TODO: Might be an operator
// ‚ä•  is both a symbol (false) and an operator (A perpendicular B)

// TODO: bracket pairs are to be resolved during parsing (pairs, ghost close bracket, esc and space, set builder |, |abs|, ||norm||, {x| |x| < 3})
