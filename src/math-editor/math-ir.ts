// Time to try out the "IR" approach
// Things like mpadded or mphantom or styling won't be modeled for now

// a caret basically points at some position in the tree

// Placeholder symbol: â¬š
// Canoical symbol form (like when there are multiple unicode characters or when some HTML escape has been used &lt;)

// Brackets question: sub-tree or nah? (includes |abs|)
// if subtree: brackets stop being symbols, instead you can place the caret outside of the brackets and then there is another expression (usually row) inside them
// if not subtree: we need to find the ending bracket. which means that in the case of |abs|, we need to wrap it in its own row. and when |abs| gets deleted or edited, we gotta get rid of the useless row

/**
 * A simple, JSON-compatible representation of a math formula.
 * Optimized for editing, purposefully does not assign meaning to most characters.
 * For instance, if the formula contains "0xe", we just say it has the characters 0, x, e.
 * We don't parse it as a hexadecimal or 0*x*e or anything. That part is done later.
