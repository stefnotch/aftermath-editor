// Brackets question: sub-tree or nah? (includes |abs|)
// if subtree: brackets stop being symbols, instead you can place the caret outside of the brackets and then there is another expression (usually row) inside them
// if not subtree: we need to find the ending bracket. which means that in the case of |abs|, we need to wrap it in its own row. and when |abs| gets deleted or edited, we gotta get rid of the useless row
